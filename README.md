# CCA Aging

The analysis code for performing the analyses in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.312090v1.abstract) distributed as a toolbox of MATLAB functions for reproducibility.

TODO:
1. Clean up the order / comments in the scripts that produce results used in the paper for readability.
2. Make sure the functions are usefully commented - mostly done
    - Remove functions that aren't used / relevant (?) - some unused / unifished analyses and plots are versioned in folders
3. Figure out if external dependencies can be added as submodules or need to a be a folder
